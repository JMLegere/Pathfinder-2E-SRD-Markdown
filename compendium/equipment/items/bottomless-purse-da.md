# Bottomless Purse *Item 8*

[contract](rules/traits/contract-lol.md) [invested](rules/traits/invested.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Category** Contract

With a handshake, you traded future wealth for a bottomless purse of gems and other valuables. Using the purse, you can always sell items for their normal sell value during downtime, even if you aren't anywhere near a settlement. You just put them into the purse, and within a day, the proper sale price appears in coins and gems. Once per day, from any distance, the entity that holds your bargained contract automatically sells a common consumable item in your possession, giving you back only half the normal amount for a sold item.

You deposit up to 30 gp of gems and coins in a separate pouch of the bottomless purse while thinking of a common consumable item costing that amount of money.

You then upend the pouch. The item you envisioned comes tumbling out into your hand.
