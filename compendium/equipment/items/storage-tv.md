# Storage *Item 0*

[adjustment](rules/traits/adjustment-lotgb.md)  

- **Price** 1 gp
- **Usage** applied to armor or unarmored defense clothing; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Adjustment

The storage adjustment fits the armor or clothing with belts, buckles, pouches, and loops for holding and storing tools. Countless fasteners make the armor as jangly as [chain mail](compendium/equipment/items/chain-mail.md).

While wearing armor with this adjustment, you can wear up to 3 Bulk of tools instead of the usual 2. However, the armor acquires the [noisy](rules/traits/noisy.md) trait. If it already has the [noisy](rules/traits/noisy.md) trait, increase its penalty to [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks by 1.
