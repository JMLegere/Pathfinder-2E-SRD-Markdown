# Concealed Sheath *Item 3*

- **Price** 25 gp
- **Category** Adventuring Gear

This leather sheath is large enough to hold an item of up to light Bulk and is typically used for [daggers](compendium/equipment/items/dagger.md), wands, [thieves' tools](compendium/equipment/items/thieves-tools.md), and similar objects. You can affix it to the inside of a boot, under a bracer or sleeve, or in other inconspicuous locations to gain a +1 item bonus to [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks and DCs to hide or conceal the item within.
