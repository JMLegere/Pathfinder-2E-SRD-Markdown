# Mesmerizing Opal *Item 2*

[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md) [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md)  

- **Price** 7 gp
- **Usage** affixed to armor; **Bulk**â€”
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You attempt a [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check to [Feint](rules/actions/feint.md), but you haven't rolled yet.
- **Category** Talisman

This silver-bound opal pendant is afire with iridescence.

When you activate it, if the outcome of your triggering [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) check is a critical failure, you get a failure instead (or if the outcome is a success, you get a critical success instead).
