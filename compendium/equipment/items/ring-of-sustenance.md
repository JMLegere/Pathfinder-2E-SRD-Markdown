This polished wooden ring constantly refreshes your body and mind. You don't need to eat or drink while wearing it, and you need only 2 hours of sleep per day to gain the benefits of 8 hours of sleep. A ring of sustenance doesn't function until it's been worn and invested continuously for a week. Removing it resets this interval.
