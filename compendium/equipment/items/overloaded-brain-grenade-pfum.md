It's possible for a desperate alchemist to rig the brain container of a defeated alchemical golem to create a volatile (if unusual) explosive. You throw the grenade up to 60 feet, and it explodes, dealing `3d6` fire damage and `3d6` mental damage in a 10-foot burst (DC 27 basic Reflex save). On a critical failure, a creature takes `2d6` [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
