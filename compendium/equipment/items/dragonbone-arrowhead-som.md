# Dragonbone Arrowhead *Item 4*

[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md) [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md)  

- **Price** 20 gp
- **Usage** affixed to a melee weapon or a ranged weapon
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md); **Requirements** You're an expert with the affixed weapon.
- **Category** Talisman

This arrowhead, carved from dragon bone, hangs off the shaft of your weapon. When you activate this talisman, until the end of the current turn, the affixed weapon gains the thrown <20 feet> weapon trait, and when you make a thrown [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with it, it flies back to your hand after the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) completes. If your hands are full when the weapon returns, it falls to the ground in your space.
