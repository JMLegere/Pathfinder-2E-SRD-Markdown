# Powder *Item 0*

[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md)  

- **Price** 1 sp
- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Consumable

A bag of powder contains powdered chalk, flour, or similar materials. In addition to other uses for powder, it can be handy while adventuring to help pinpoint [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) creatures.

You can throw the powder into an adjacent square as an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action. If there's a creature in that square, it becomes temporarily [observed](rules/conditions.md#Observed) until the end of your turn, though the creature still has concealment due to invisibility. The powder quickly falls away or becomes [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) itself, preventing you from tracking the creature indefinitely.
