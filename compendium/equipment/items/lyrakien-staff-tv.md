# Lyrakien Staff *Item 6+*

[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [staff](rules/traits/staff.md)  

- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Staff

A crystalline sphere, swirling with constantly shifting constellations, sits atop a lyrakien staff, a silver shaft that sparkles with the gentle glow of starlight. Desnans first created the staves, inspired by the musicand freedom-loving lyrakien azatas, but these staves are popular with spellcasters of all faiths who like travel, art, or the stars. While wielding a lyrakien staff, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws against [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md) effects.
