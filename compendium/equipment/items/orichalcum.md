# Orichalcum *Item 17+*

[precious](rules/traits/precious.md) [rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Category** Material

The most rare and valuable skymetal, orichalcum is coveted for its incredible time-related magical properties. This dull, coppery metal isn't as physically sturdy as adamantine, but orichalcum's time-bending properties protect it, granting it greater Hardness and Hit Points. If an orichalcum item takes damage but isn't destroyed, it repairs itself completely 24 hours later.

| Orichalcum Items | Hardness | HP | BT |
|------------------|----------|----|----|
| **Thin Items** |  |  |  |
| High-grade | 16 | 64 | 32 |
| **Items** |  |  |  |
| High-grade | 18 | 72 | 36 |
| **Structures** |  |  |  |
| High-grade | 35 | 140 | 70 |
