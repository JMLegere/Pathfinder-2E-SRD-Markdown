This elegant silver band often resembles curling fig leaves and fits around your brow. You gain a +2 item bonus to [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) and [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks.

When you invest the circlet, you either increase your Charisma score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.
