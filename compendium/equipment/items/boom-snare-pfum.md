By combining a lesser alchemist's fire, a lesser thunderstone, and other catalysts with a pressure sensitive trigger, you create a snare that creates a fiery and thunderous explosion when triggered. The target and all creatures in adjacent squares take `2d6` fire damage and `2d6` sonic damage with a basic DC 19 Reflex save. On a failure, they are [deafened](rules/conditions.md#Deafened) for `1d4` rounds and take `1d4` [persistent fire damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
