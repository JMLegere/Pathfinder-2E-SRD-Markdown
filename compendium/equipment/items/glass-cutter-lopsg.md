## Glass Cutter *Item 0*

[uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)

- **Price** 5 gp
- **Bulk** L
- **Hands** 2
- **Category** Adventuring Gear

This small rod has a tiny, sharp cutting wheel made of steel on one end and a thick bulb on the other. You can use the glass cutter's wheel to score ordinary glass and use the bulb to break the piece along your scoring. It typically takes 1 minute of work to cut a hole large enough to fit your hand. If you are attempting to break the glass quietly, you must attempt a [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) check against the [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) DC of nearby creatures to go unnoticed.
