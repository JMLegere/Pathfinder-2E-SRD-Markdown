In its normal form, a spy staff is a slim rod of burnished wood with subtle etchings of eyes upon its sides. The first to develop the spy staff were agents of Andoran's Twilight Talons, but such staves have spread to espionage agencies throughout the Inner Sea region and beyond.

You change the shape and appearance of this staff to that of an ordinary handheld accessory of your choosing of the same Bulk. The staff's statistics don't change. Only a creature benefiting from true seeing or a similar effect can attempt to disbelieve this illusion, with a DC of 27.
