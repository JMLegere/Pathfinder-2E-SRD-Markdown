# Earplugs *Item 0*

- **Price** 1 cp
- **Category** Adventuring Gear

Made of waxed cotton or cork, earplugs give you a +1 item bonus to saves against effects with the [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md) trait. The earplugs make it difficult to hear, however, imposing aâ€“2 item penalty on [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception) checks involving sound. Inserting or removing the earplugs requires an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action.
