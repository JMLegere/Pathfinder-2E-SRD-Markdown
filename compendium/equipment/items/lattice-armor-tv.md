# Lattice Armor *Item 0*

- **Price** 9 gp
- **Bulk** 2
- **AC Bonus** +4; **Dex Cap** +1
- **Strength** 16; **Check Penalty** --2; **Speed Penalty** -5 ft.
- **Category** Medium; **Group** Chain

Fine metal cables woven into latticework patterns form this armor. This armor disperses blows much like rings of chain mail, but is much tighter in construction, making it quieter.
