When you invest this clear quartz crystal ball, it orbits your head like an aeon stone. As long as you have the stargazer invested, you can use an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to direct it to orbit one of your hands where you can telekinetically smash the orb into foes, wielding it as a +2 greater striking returning club.

While you're directing the stargazer, your hand is full, and you can send it back to your head with another [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action.

On a critical hit, the stargazer pulses with hypnotic starlight, dazzling the struck creature for 1 round. A stargazer doesn't add critical specialization effects.
