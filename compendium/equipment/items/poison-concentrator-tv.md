This compression apparatus can reduce two poisons into a more concentrated dose. As a 10-minute activity that has the [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait, you can use a poison concentrator to combine two doses of the same alchemical poison, creating a single concentrated poison with a +1 item bonus to its DC.
