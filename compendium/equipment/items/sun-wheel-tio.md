Created by the priests of a Qadiran sect of [Sarenites](compendium/setting/deities/sarenrae.md), the *sun wheels* were designed to protect the [Dawnflower](compendium/setting/deities/sarenrae.md)'s followers in their quest to hunt down a dangerous cult trying to raise a spawn of the evil god [Rovagug](compendium/setting/deities/rovagug.md). Once they completed their crusade, these priests disbanded and went on to minister other congregations. They each took their *sun wheels* with them, handing them down to the next generations.

This copper medallion is etched with a stylized sun, its rays shaped like the spokes of a wagon wheel. It tends to glint brightly when exposed to sunlight. While wearing this pendant, you gain a +1 item bonus to [Religion](compendium/skills.md#Religion) checks.

You must be good-aligned to use the *sun wheel*'s true power: the following activation, which provides you a shield of burning force.

[concentrate](rules/traits/concentrate.md)  

The sun wheel casts a [shield](compendium/spells/shield.md) spell benefiting you. When you use the spell to prevent damage, you prevent 10 damage instead of 5. If the attacker is adjacent to you, you can choose to deal `2d6` fire damage to it, which it gets a DC 21 basic Reflex save to resist.

If you choose to deal the fire damage, you can't [Activate](rules/actions/activate-an-item.md) the sun wheel again until the next morning.

If you prevent damage but don't deal the fire damage, you can use it again in 10 minutes, as normal for [shield](compendium/spells/shield.md).
