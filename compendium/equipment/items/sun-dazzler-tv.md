This metallic tube has a complex array of lenses and prisms at one end and a hatch at the other. The hatch can be unlocked, loaded with a sunrod, and refastened using 3 [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions.

A loaded sun dazzler can be activated to burn the sunrod to dust in a single focused flash, creating a 30-foot cone of scintillating light. All creatures in the cone must attempt a DC 24 Fortitude save, with the following effects.

> - **Critical Failure** The creature is [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round.
