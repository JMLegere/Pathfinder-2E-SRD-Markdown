# Cloak of Elvenkind *Item 7+*

[illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md) [invested](rules/traits/invested.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Usage** worn cloak; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Worn

This cloak is deep green with a voluminous hood, embroidered with gold trim and symbols significant in elven culture. The cloak allows you to cast the [ghost sound](compendium/spells/ghost-sound.md) cantrip as an arcane innate spell. When you adjust the cloak's clasp (an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action), the cloak transforms to match the environment around you and muffles your sounds, granting you a +1 item bonus to [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You draw the hood up and gain the effects of invisibility, with the spell's normal duration or until you pull the hood back down, whichever comes first. If you're also wearing boots of elvenkind, you can activate this ability twice per day.
