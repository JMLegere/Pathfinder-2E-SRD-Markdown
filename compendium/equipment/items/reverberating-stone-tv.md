# Reverberating Stone *Item 11+*

[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md) [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md)  

- **Usage** affixed to a shield; **Bulk**â€”
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You use the affixed shield to Shield Block a melee attack; **Requirements** You're a master in [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics), and you have the affixed shield raised.
- **Category** Talisman

This heavy metal emblem is mounted on the face of the affixed shield and has a dull gray gemstone embedded at its center. When you Activate the talisman, the gem shatters, releasing a powerful shockwave in a 15-foot cone that must include the enemy who struck the triggering blow, if possible. Each creature in the cone takes `2d6` sonic damage with a DC 28 basic Fortitude save. Any creature that fails its save is pushed 5 feet away from you (or 10 feet on a critical failure).
