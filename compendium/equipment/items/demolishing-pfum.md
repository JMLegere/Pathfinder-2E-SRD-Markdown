# Demolishing *Item 6*

A demolishing weapon is made to destroy constructs. Damage inflicted on a construct with a demolishing weapon continues to spread throughout the creature—cracks form, linkages fail, surfaces erode—and otherwise dismantle its body. When you damage a construct using a demolishing weapon, you deal an extra `1d6` [persistent force damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). On a critical hit, you deal an extra `1d12` [persistent force damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) instead.
