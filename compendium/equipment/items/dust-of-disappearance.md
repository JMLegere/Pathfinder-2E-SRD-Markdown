This powder shimmers like a thousand tiny motes of light.

Activating the dust by sprinkling it on yourself or a creature within reach casts a 4th-level [invisibility](compendium/spells/invisibility.md) spell with a duration of 1 minute on that creature. This invisibility can't be negated or seen through by any spell of 3rd level or lower or any item of 5th level or lower.
