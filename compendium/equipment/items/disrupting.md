# Disrupting *Item 5+*

[magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md)  

- **Usage** etched onto a melee weapon
- **Category** Rune

A disrupting weapon pulses with positive energy, dealing an extra `1d6` positive damage to undead. On a critical hit, the undead is also [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) until the end of your next turn.
