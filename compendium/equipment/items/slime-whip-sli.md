This thick, greasy +1 striking shifting whip is made from a slimy pseudopod. You don't take the usualâ€“2 circumstance penalty to your attack rolls when using the slime whip to make a lethal attack. The whip's form can be changed just like any weapon with the shifting rune, but it reverts to its original form as soon as it isn't wielded. When in its whip form, you can use the following action.

For 1 round, the slime whip deals acid damage rather than slashing damage. If the attack deals [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), the [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) is also acid damage instead of its usual type.
