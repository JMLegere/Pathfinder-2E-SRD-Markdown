You are a master with the affixed weapon.

This miniature iron cudgel is typically affixed to a weapon by an iron chain. When you activate the cudgel, you use Brutal Finish, as the fighter feat (page 151). You must meet the normal requirements, including those of the [press](rules/traits/press.md) trait.

If you have the Brutal Finish feat, add two additional weapon damage dice on a success or a failure.
