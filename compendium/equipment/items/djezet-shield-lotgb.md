[rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Usage** varies by shield
- **Category** Material

The burnished red faces of djezet-alloy shields attract effects made of pure magic. While you have a djezet shield Raised, you can use the Shield Block reaction when you would take energy damage in addition to the reaction's usual trigger.

When taking energy damage from a spell, the shield's listed Hardness doubles.
