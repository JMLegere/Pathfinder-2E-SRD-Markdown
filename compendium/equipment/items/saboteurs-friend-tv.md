# Saboteur's Friend *Item 4*

[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md) [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md) [ingested](rules/traits/ingested.md) [poison](rules/traits/poison.md)  

- **Price** 14 gp
- **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)
- **Category** Poison

The euphemistically named saboteur's friend looks, smells, and tastes like an appetizing chocolate square. You lace the chocolate with reagents that induce a strong laxative effect.

Saboteur's friend is useful for incapacitating rather than dealing lasting harm. Unlike some poisons, saboteur's friend can have its [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition reduced (but changing to a higher or lower stage after a save applies any [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition listed for that stage, as normal).

```ad-inline-affliction
