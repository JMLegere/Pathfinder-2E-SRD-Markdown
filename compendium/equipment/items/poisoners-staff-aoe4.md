# Poisoner's Staff *Item 4+*

[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md) [staff](rules/traits/staff.md) [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Staff

This gnarled staff is covered with thorns and coated with a glistening lacquer that acts as a minor irritant.

While holding the staff, you aren't affected by its coating or thorns, and you reduce the DC of your flat checks to overcome [persistent poison damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate

You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
```
