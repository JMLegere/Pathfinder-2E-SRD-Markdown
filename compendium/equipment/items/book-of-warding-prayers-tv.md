- **Trigger**: Your last action was to cast a prepared divine spell granted by your deity

**Effect** Choose chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; you can't choose a type that's part of your deity's alignment. You and all allies within 30 feet are suffused with your deity's protection, gaining resistance 10 to damage of that type for 1 minute.
