# Skeleton Key *Item 5+*

[magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk**â€”
- **Category** Held

A grinning skull tops the bow of this macabre key. This key can be used in place of [thieves' tools](compendium/equipment/items/thieves-tools.md) when attempting to [Pick a Lock](rules/actions/pick-a-lock.md), and it grants a +1 item bonus to the [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery) check.

If the skeleton key becomes [broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken) due to a critical failure on the check, it works as normal [thieves' tools](compendium/equipment/items/thieves-tools.md) and loses its benefits until repaired.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action")

- **Trigger**: You attempt to [Pick a Lock](rules/actions/pick-a-lock.md) but haven't rolled yet

**Effect** The key casts knock on the lock you're trying to pick.
