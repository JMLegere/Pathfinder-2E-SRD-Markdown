This shining symbol of [Sarenrae](compendium/setting/deities/sarenrae.md) depicts the goddess with her arms held wide. In the center of the symbol is a crystal reliquary with a perfect feather floating inside, glowing bright as a candle with the light of the goddess.

title: Activate

The dawnlight casts 1st-level [disrupt undead](compendium/spells/disrupt-undead.md) or light. The dawnlight's spell attack roll and counteract modifier are +7, and any spell with the [light](rules/traits/light.md) trait is treated as though its counteract level were 1 higher for counteracting darkness.
