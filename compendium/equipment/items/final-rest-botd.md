# Final Rest *Item 18*

[magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md)  

- **Price** 24000 gp
- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Held

This +3 greater disrupting greater striking silver longsword is made from the purest silver. The blade is carefully etched to depict a vast and sprawling necropolis, a place where the dead are laid to rest. Whenever you critically hit an undead creature with final rest, the undead creature takes `3d6` [persistent good damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), with a DC 36 Fortitude save.

> [!success-degree]
> - **Critical Success** No effect.
> - **Success** The creature takes half the [persistent good damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Failure** The creature is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) and takes the full [persistent good damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) and takes double the [persistent good damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
