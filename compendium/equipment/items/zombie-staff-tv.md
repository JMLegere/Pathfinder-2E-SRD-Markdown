# Zombie Staff *Item 7+*

[magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md) [staff](rules/traits/staff.md)  

- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Staff

A zombie staff is etched with the rotting visage of an undead humanoid grimacing in terror and dismay carved atop it. The staff's [animate dead](compendium/spells/animate-dead-apg.md) spells can be used only to animate undead that have flesh and an Intelligence modifier of–4 or lower.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate

You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list. If you cast [animate dead](compendium/spells/animate-dead-apg.md), you can also cast [protect companion](compendium/spells/protect-companion-som.md) on the resulting minion as a free action.
