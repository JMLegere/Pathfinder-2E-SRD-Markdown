# Degenerating *Item 5*

[acid](rules/traits/acid.md) [cursed](rules/traits/cursed-gmg.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md) [rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Usage** curses a weapon
- **Category** Curse

Failure makes the weapon crumble. Whenever you critically fail an attack roll with the weapon, the *degenerating* curse deals `1d10` acid damage to the weapon, ignoring its Hardness and resistances.
