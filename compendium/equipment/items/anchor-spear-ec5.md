- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Held

The tip of this +2 greater striking spear is large and wickedly barbed, and the haft is inlaid with fine silver lines that run the length of the weapon. Wielded by specially trained xulgath cavalry, anchor spears are used to prevent the escape of gogiteths or other monsters capable of climbing or burrowing.

The anchor spear extends into a +2 greater striking longspear or back to its original form as a +2 greater striking spear.

- **Trigger**: You damage a creature using the anchor spear

**Effect** The spear embeds itself into the creature, and the spear's haft splits along the silver lines to become a series of hooks attached to a thin but strong cable. As long as the anchor spear remains embedded in the creature, any time the creature burrows or climbs, it treats normal terrain as difficult terrain and difficult terrain as greater difficult terrain. The creature can spend an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to attempt a DC 32 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to remove the spearhead.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The anchor spear is removed, becomes [broken](rules/conditions.md#Broken), and falls to the ground in the creature's space.
> - **Success** The anchor spear is removed, the creature takes `1d8` piercing damage, and the spear falls to the ground in a random space adjacent to the creature.
> - **Failure** The anchor spear remains in place, and the creature takes `1d8` piercing damage.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, except the creature takes `2d8` piercing damage.
