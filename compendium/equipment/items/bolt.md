# Bolt *Item 0*

- **Bulk** L
- **Category** Ammunition

Shorter than traditional arrows but similar in construction, bolts are the ammunition used by crossbows.

> [!pf2-note]  
> Different weapons have different prices for ammunition. The prices listed are thus, only for reference in the weapon statblocks themselves.
