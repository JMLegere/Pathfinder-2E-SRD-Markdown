Also called a "slungshot," the monkey's fist is a short length of rope ending in a thick knot wrapped around a metal weight. You can tie the loose end of a monkey's fist to your wrist; if you are [disarmed](rules/actions/disarm.md), the weapon remains secured to your wrist rather than falling to the ground, though you must use an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to grip it before using it again. A monkey's fist is a martial melee weapon.
