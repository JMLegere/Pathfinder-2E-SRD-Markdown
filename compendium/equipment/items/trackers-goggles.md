# Tracker's Goggles *Item 3+*

[divination](rules/traits/divination.md) [invested](rules/traits/invested.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Usage** worn eyepiece
- **Category** Worn

These lenses of forest-green glass are bound in rough leather stitched with crude twine. While wearing these goggles, you gain a +1 bonus to [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) checks to [Sense Direction](rules/actions/sense-direction.md) and [Track](rules/actions/track.md). If you fail a check to [Track](rules/actions/track.md), you can try again after 30 minutes rather than an hour.
