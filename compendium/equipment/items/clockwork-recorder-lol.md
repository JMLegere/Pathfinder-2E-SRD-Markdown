# Clockwork Recorder *Item 6*

- **Price** 250 gp
- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Held

This small recording device can be as tiny as a music box or around the size of large book and is typically [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed) in hollowed-out books and jewelry. A clockwork recorder can record up to 1 hour of sound before its wax cylinders must be retrieved and replaced.

Any given clockwork recorder can play back the recordings of a cylinder, regardless of whether it was the recorder used for the original recording.

You wind the recorder to start recording sound or to play back a recording. You can have the recording or playback start immediately or be timed to start at any point up to one month later.
