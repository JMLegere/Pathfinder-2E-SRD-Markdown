# Swim Fins *Item 0*

- **Price** 5 gp
- **Usage** worn shoes; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Worn

These flippers attach to your feet like tight shoes—donning or removing them requires three [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) actions. While worn, you gain a +5-foot item bonus to the distance you move when rolling [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) to [Swim](rules/actions/swim.md), not when using a swim Speed, and you take a–10-foot item penalty to your Speed.
