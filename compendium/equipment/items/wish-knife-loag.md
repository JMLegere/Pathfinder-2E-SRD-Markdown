- **Damage** `1d4` P
- **Hands** 1
- **Category** Martial; **Group** Knife

Much like a [wish blade](compendium/equipment/items/wish-blade-loag.md), the length of this knife is scored with intricate grooves capable of retaining energy. Wish knives are lighter than their counterparts, making them the weapon of choice for agile combatants.
