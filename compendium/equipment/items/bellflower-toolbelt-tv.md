# Bellflower Toolbelt *Item 6*

[invested](rules/traits/invested.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [rare](rules/traits/rare.md) [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Price** 220 gp
- **Usage** worn belt; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Worn

Different versions of the bellflower toolbelt are customized to appear to suit specific trades, so a belt used for carpentry would look different from a belt for baking.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You place an object of up to 1 Bulk into the belt, transforming that object into a tool befitting the trade for which the belt was created. Each object remains transformed until it has been removed from the belt for 24 hours or someone uses a single [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to return it to its normal form. If enough transformed items are in it, the belt can be used as artisan's tools for that trade.
