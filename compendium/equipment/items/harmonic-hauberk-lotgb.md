# Harmonic Hauberk *Item 13*

[auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md) [focused](rules/traits/focused.md) [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md) [invested](rules/traits/invested.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 2500 gp
- **Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Armor

Rose gold and copper rings in this +2 resilient chain shirt form a vague bird shape. The jingling links tinkle musically, almost like birdsong. While you wear the armor, effects with the [auditory](rules/traits/auditory.md) trait must first counteract the harmonic hauberk or they have no effect on you.

The harmonic hauberk attempts to counteract [silence](compendium/spells/silence.md) spells cast on you and 4th-level or higher heightened [silence](compendium/spells/silence.md) spells the first time the armor enters their area (counteract level 4, counteract modifier +20). After failing to counteract a [silence](compendium/spells/silence.md) spell, the armor can't attempt to counteract the same spell again, even if you leave and enter the spell's area multiple times.

title: Activate [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You gain 1 Focus Point and immediately use the Focus Point to cast [lingering composition](compendium/spells/lingering-composition.md) (Core Rulebook 387), using your [Performance](compendium/skills.md#Performance) check to determine the effects of the spell, followed by the [inspire defense](compendium/spells/inspire-defense.md) composition cantrip (Core Rulebook 386). You can use this activation to cast those spells even if you don't have the Lingering Composition or Inspire Defense feats.
