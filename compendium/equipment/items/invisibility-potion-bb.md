# Invisibility Potion *Item 4*

[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md) [illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [potion](rules/traits/potion.md)  

- **Price** 20 gp
- **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Category** Potion

When you drink this potion, you turn [invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) for 10 minutes. Creatures can't see you, but they might be able for 10 minutes. Creatures can't see you, but they might be able to [Seek](rules/actions/seek.md) to figure out your location (though they still need to succeed at a DC 11 flat check to target you). If you attack a creature or use another hostile action, the potion's magic ends as soon as your hostile action is completed.
