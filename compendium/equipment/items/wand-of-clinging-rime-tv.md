title: Activate

You cast [frigid flurry](compendium/spells/frigid-flurry-som.md) (Secrets of Magic 108) of the indicated level. After you cast the spell, the ice crystals freeze to flesh and other surfaces, clinging to the creatures in the area. Each creature that fails its save takes [persistent cold damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) with the amount determined by the wand's type.
