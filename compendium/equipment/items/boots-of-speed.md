You click the heels of the boots together and gain the [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened) condition for 1 minute. You can use the extra action to [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md), [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md), or [Swim](rules/actions/swim.md). (You must still attempt an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check for the [Climb](rules/actions/climb.md) and [Swim](rules/actions/swim.md) actions unless you have the appropriate movement type.)
