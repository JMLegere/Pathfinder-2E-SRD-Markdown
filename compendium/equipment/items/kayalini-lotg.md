# Kayalini *Item 0*

- **Price** 5 gp
- **Category** Pet

Originally brought to Absalom by kayals fleeing the Shadow Plane, kayalinis are shy creatures made from shadow. They resemble small monkeys with reptilian features like claws, short horns, and long, shadowy tongues. When in a new home, they tend to hide under beds or in closets. Around people they trust, they'll sit quietly on a lap for hours.
