The vials containing this translucent, unsubstantial oil are always cold to the touch. Applying ghost oil to a melee weapon you're wielding or carrying causes it to become semitransparent and gain the effects of a [ghost touch](compendium/equipment/items/ghost-touch.md) rune, but it also makes the weapon unable to harm corporeal creatures. The oil has no effect when applied to another creature's weapon. The effect of the oil lasts for 1 minute.
