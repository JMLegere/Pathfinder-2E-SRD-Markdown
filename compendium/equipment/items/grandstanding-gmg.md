# Grandstanding *Item 11*

[cursed](rules/traits/cursed-gmg.md) [enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Usage** curses a weapon
- **Category** Curse

Weapons with the *grandstanding* curse inspire overconfidence in their wielders, demanding style over pragmatism. Whenever you reduce a foe to 0 Hit Points, you lose all remaining actions on your turn, as you are compelled to flourish, gloat, pose, or otherwise waste your time in response.
