# Opossum, Domestic *Item 0*

- **Price** 2 gp
- **Category** Pet

This tamed version of the wild Arcadian opossum is favored by those who like to match outfits with their pets, as the domestic opossum tolerates clothing and accessories. They're very tolerant of travel and can eat table scraps, making them popular with caravan drivers or ship captains.
