# Arsonous *Item 7*

[cursed](rules/traits/cursed-gmg.md) [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md) [fire](rules/traits/fire.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Usage** curses a ring, staff, or wand
- **Category** Curse

An *arsonous* curse creates flaws in the mystic pathways that channel magic through an item, allowing excess power to escape as sparks. Whenever you [activate](rules/actions/activate-an-item.md) the magic item, a random ally within 30 feet takes `1d10` persistent fire damage. If no ally is in range, you take the damage instead. At the GM's discretion, this curse might ignite an unattended object or the surrounding environment instead.
