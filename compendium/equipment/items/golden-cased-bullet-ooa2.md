# Golden-Cased Bullet *Item 4+*

[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md) [divination](rules/traits/divination.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Ammunition** round
- **Activate** envision
- **Category** Consumable

The magic-infused metal of this bullet's golden casing allows it to curve just a bit in flight once the bullet has been fired, allowing you to ignore the bonus to AC granted to a target in lesser cover.
