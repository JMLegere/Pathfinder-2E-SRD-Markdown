# Peachwood *Item 8+*

[precious](rules/traits/precious.md) [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Category** Material

Peachwood, often cultivated by Pharasmin priests, can ward against undeadâ€”even incorporeal ones. However, the wood loses its magical properties when it comes in contact with metal, requiring advanced carpentry to make full use of it.
