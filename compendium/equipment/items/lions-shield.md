This steel shield (Hardness 6, HP 36, BT 18) is forged into the shape of a roaring lion's head.

The lion's head functions as +1 striking shield boss that can't be removed from the shield.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You animate the lion's head. You Raise the Shield and make a melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with it as part of the same action. The shield's biting maw is a martial melee weapon that deals `2d6` piercing damage and has the deadly `1d6` trait; it can't be enhanced by runes. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, during which time you can [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with it each time you Raise the Shield, as well as with a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) action.
```
