# Misleading *Item 16*

[illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Price** 8000 gp
- **Usage** etched onto light armor
- **Category** Rune

This rune attempts to obfuscate your location through illusory trickery. When you're [concealed](rules/conditions.md#Concealed), the DC of the flat check to target you with an effect is 6 instead of 5.

The armor casts mislead, affecting you. It lasts until the end of your next turn.
