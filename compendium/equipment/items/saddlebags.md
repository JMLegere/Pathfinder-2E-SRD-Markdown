# Saddlebags *Item 0*

Saddlebags come in a pair. Each can hold up to 3 Bulk of items, and the first 1 Bulk of items in each doesn't count against your mount's Bulk limit. The Bulk value given is for saddlebags worn by a mount. If you are carrying or stowing saddlebags, they count as 1 Bulk instead of light Bulk.
