A repair kit allows you to perform simple repairs while traveling. It contains a portable anvil, tongs, woodworking tools, a whetstone, and oils for conditioning leather and wood. You can use a repair kit to [Repair](rules/actions/repair.md) items using the [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) skill. You can draw and replace a worn repair kit as part of the action that uses it.
