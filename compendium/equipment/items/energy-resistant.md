# Energy-Resistant *Item 8+*

[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Usage** etched onto armor
- **Category** Rune

These symbols convey protective forces from the Elemental Planes. You gain resistance 5 to acid, cold, electricity, or fire.

The crafter chooses the damage type when creating the rune.

Multiple energy-resistant runes can be etched onto a suit of armor; rather than using only the highest-level effect, each must provide resistance to a different damage type. For instance, a +2 acid-resistant greater fire-resistant breastplate would give you acid resistance 5 and fire resistance 10.
