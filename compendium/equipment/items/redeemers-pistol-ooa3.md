This +2 striking dueling pistol (Guns & Gears 152) is fashioned from silvery steel that glistens with a radiant light. You can choose to make a nonlethal attack with the redeemer's pistol without taking aâ€“2 penalty; if you do so, the attack deals `1d6` additional mental damage. You can also call forth the redemptive spirit within the gun to pass judgment on your foes.

- **Trigger**: An enemy within 30 feet damages you

**Effect** The protective spirit within the gun imposes a vision of redemption in your foe's mind. The foe must choose one of the following options.

- You're unharmed by the triggering damage.
- You gain resistance to all damage against the triggering damage equal to 2 + your level. After the damaging effect is applied, the enemy becomes [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) until the end of its next turn and takes 4 [persistent good damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
