# Chopping Evisceration Snare *Item 14*

- **Price** 700 gp
- **Category** Snare

An almost-impossible number of axes spring out at a target with lethal force. When a creature enters the snare's square, it's nearly buried beneath a storm of sharpened metal, which deals `16d8` slashing damage (DC 33 basic Reflex).
