- **Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Held

Astrolabes can be used for navigation in unfamiliar or featureless locations. To use an astrolabe, the holder must be trained in [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival). By spending 1 minute to measure the height of the stars and planets, a holder who knows the time and date can determine the latitude, and a holder who knows their latitude can determine the date and time. An astrolabe also grants a +1 item bonus on checks to identify celestial bodies. A standard astrolabe only functions on steady ground.
