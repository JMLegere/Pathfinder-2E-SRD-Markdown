# Spirit-sealing Fulu *Item 3+*

[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md) [fulu](rules/traits/fulu-som.md) [incapacitation](rules/traits/incapacitation.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md)  

- **Usage** affixed to one undead creature
- **Duration** 1 round (or 4 rounds)
- **Category** Consumable

This classic fulu seals the negative energy within an undead, freezing it in its tracks. Upon affixing, the target undead must attempt a Will save or be [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) for 1 round.
