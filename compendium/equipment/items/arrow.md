# Arrow *Item 0*

- **Bulk** L
- **Category** Ammunition

These projectiles are the ammunition for bows. The shaft of an arrow is made of wood. It is stabilized in flight by fletching at one end and bears a metal head on the other.

> Different weapons have different prices for ammunition. The prices listed are thus, only for reference in the weapon statblocks themselves.
