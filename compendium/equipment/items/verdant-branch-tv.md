Woody vines and branches curl and twist around each other, growing small twigs, leaves, and flowers across the surface of this prosthetic arm or leg.

A branch grows from your prosthesis, quickly flowering and then producing `1d4` ripe and flavorful fruits. A creature can pick and eat a fruit with an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to regain `2d6+5` Hit Points. The fruits wither away after 10 minutes.
