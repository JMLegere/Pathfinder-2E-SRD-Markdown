# Silver Armor *Item 5+*

- **Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** varies by armor

Silver armor sickens certain creatures that touch it. A creature with weakness to silver that critically fails an unarmed attack against a creature in silver armor becomes [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened). A creature with weakness to silver is [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) as long as it wears silver armor.
