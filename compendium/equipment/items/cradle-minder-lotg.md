# Cradle Minder *Item 0*

- **Price** 50 gp
- **Category** Pet

Sought after in Cheliax, the cradle minder resembles an imp. Despite rumors they were given as part of household pacts with devils, these creatures were bred from fiendish frogs. Amphibious, they have leathery wings, frog-like eyes, and a forgiving temperament. They're ideal companions for children, as they tend to bond closely with one person and let out loud croaks when they become aware of danger. They require fiendish earthworms (unique feed) regularly, so ensuring you have a stable food supply is a necessity for ownership.
