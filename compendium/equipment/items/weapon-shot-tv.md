# Weapon Shot *Item 5+*

[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md) [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Ammunition** any
- **Category** Consumable

The body of a weapon shot is translucent and filled with quicksilver. It imparts its magic to the weapon used to fire it or it summons a translucent weapon, made of force, to fire it.

It's a favorite of killers and sharpshooters who need just one shot in a situation where carrying ammunition is easier than carrying a weapon.

For the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with which you consume the ammunition, use the ammunition's fundamental runes, according to its type, instead of those of the weapon firing it.

A ghostly weapon made of force appears, wielded by you and loaded with the weapon shot you activated. The conjured weapon sublimates into motes of briefly luminous dust if the weapon shot deactivates without you using it or just after you use the activated shot. For the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with which it functions, the weapon uses the ammunition's fundamental runes, according to its type.
