# Heedless Spurs *Item 15*

[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Price** 5200 gp
- **Usage** worn anklets; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Worn

These wicked-looking spiked metal wheels fit around the ankles and jingle when the wearer walks, imposing aâ€“1 item penalty on [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) checks. If used as a weapon, they are treated as a spiked gauntlet.

- **Requirements**: You are riding a mount

**Effect** You kick both spurs into your mount's flank. Your mount takes `2d6` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and gains the [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened) condition for 1 minute or until the [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) ends, whichever comes first. It can use the extra action only to [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md).
