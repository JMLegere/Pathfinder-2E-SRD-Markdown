- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Wand

Carvings of skulls, monsters, and all manner of violence decorate this wand of blackened bone, but it makes absurd sounds when Activated, such as a honking horn, a manic giggle, or a daydreamy sigh.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate

You cast [impending doom](compendium/spells/impending-doom-som.md) (Secrets of Magic 110) of the indicated level, showing the target a potential death that's gruesome and absurd. If the target becomes [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) by the spell, it also becomes [stupefied](rules/conditions.md#Stupefied) with a value 1 higher than the [frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) value. This lasts for the duration of the spell.
