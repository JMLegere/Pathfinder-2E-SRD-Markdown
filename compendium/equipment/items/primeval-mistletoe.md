This sprig of berry-festooned holly and mistletoe doesn't wilt or rot. It can be used as a primal focus, and it also grants the creature holding it a +1 item bonus to [Nature](compendium/skills.md#Nature) checks.

You can twine the sprig around the wrist of one hand and touch a tree to cast [tree shape](compendium/spells/tree-shape.md) upon yourself, except instead of a becoming a tree, you become a vine on the touched tree.
