The shaft of this silver bolt is engraved with wiry designs.

When a garrote bolt hits a target, it transforms into a silver garrote and wraps around one of the target's appendages, dealing an additional `2d12` [persistent slashing damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). On a critical hit, it wraps around the target's throat, and the target can't breathe until the [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) ends.
