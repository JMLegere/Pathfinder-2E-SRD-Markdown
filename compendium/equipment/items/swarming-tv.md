# Swarming *Item 9*

[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Price** 700 gp
- **Usage** etched onto a thrown weapon
- **Category** Rune

Able to copy itself many times over when thrown until the air is filled with deadly blades, a swarming weapon turns a single weapon into a shower of devastation.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You fling your weapon and it multiplies as it flies through the air, filling a 30-foot cone. All creatures within the area take damage equal to double the weapon's number of damage dice, with a DC 27 basic Reflex save.
```
