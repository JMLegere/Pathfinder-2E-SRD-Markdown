# Infiltrator's Accessory *Item 5*

[illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Price** 150 gp
- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Held

This elegant +1 striking sword cane serves equally well as a fashionable accessory and [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) weapon suitable for highsociety events where weapons aren't typically permitted.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You twist the sword cane's hilt, magically merging the blade into the cane. While the blade is merged, it can't be drawn and gains the benefits of a 3rd-level [magic aura](compendium/spells/magic-aura.md) spell to appear non-magical. Passive observers can't attempt a check to notice the cane is anything more than a mundane, if superb, fashion accessory. Those carefully examining it can discern the cane is more than it appears, but doing so is extremely difficult (DC 30 [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception))

Activating the sword cane again releases the blade, allowing it to be drawn normally.
