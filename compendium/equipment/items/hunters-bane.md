# Hunter's Bane *Item 2*

[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md) [divination](rules/traits/divination.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md)  

- **Price** 6 gp
- **Usage** affixed to armor; **Bulk**â€”
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** An [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected) enemy hits you with an attack; **Requirements** You are trained in [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival).
- **Category** Talisman

This talisman is a ring of dried, interwoven leaves. When you activate the hunter's bane, you sense the exact location of the attacker, making it [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) from you instead of [undetected](rules/conditions.md#Undetected). If the attacker is behind lead, the hunter's bane fails and is wasted.
