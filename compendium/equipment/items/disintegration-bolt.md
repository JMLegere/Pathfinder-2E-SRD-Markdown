# Disintegration Bolt *Item 15*

[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md) [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 1300 gp
- **Ammunition** [bolt](compendium/equipment/items/bolt.md)
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)
- **Category** Ammunition

The shaft of this bolt is scorched and blackened, and handling it coats your fingers with a fine black powder. When an activated disintegration bolt hits a target, it is subject to a [disintegrate](compendium/spells/disintegrate.md) spell requiring a DC 34 Fortitude save. As with the spell, a critical hit on the attack roll causes the target's saving throw outcome to be one degree worse.
