Mindlock shot is made of luminous ectoplasm in a crystalline form. When you command this ammunition, you pick a [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) or [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). If you hit a creature with the ammunition, it falls under a [mental](rules/traits/mental.md) effect that makes it use its first action on its next turn to take the action you picked. It chooses exactly how to use that action, and if you choose [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md), the target can [Step](rules/actions/step.md) if doing so is beneficial for it. On a critical hit, the target must use its next 2 actions to do as you chose, within the same parameters.
