Made of pure gold with platinum strings, the phistophilus fiddle shouldn't be able to play a noteâ€”but play it does, so beautifully that it can move almost any audience. The fiddle was stolen from the contract devil who created it, and the cunning fiend still wants to reclaim the instrument. Fiendish misfortunes often befall its owners, allowing it to switch hands. The fiddle is a handheld virtuoso instrument.
