This dull black pebble, ominously cold to the touch and curiously heavy for its size, is typically bound to the affixed weapon inside a strip of cloth wrapped around its grip. When you Activate the grudgestone, your Strikes with the affixed weapon against the triggering creature gain a +3 status bonus to damage rolls for 1 minute or until the target dies, whichever comes first.
