You can coat objects of 6 Bulk or less with oil of ownership, or "redâ€‘handed oil" as some call it. Once applied, this clear oil remains active for 24 hours. Anyone who touches an object coated with this oil comes away with a red stain that won't wash off for a length of time that depends on the oil's type.
