# Aluum Charm *Item 10*

This ornate pendant of brass is adorned with a vibrant blue gemstone. An *aluum charm* grants control over a particular aluum and lesser influence over other such constructs. As long as you wear an aluum's linked *aluum charm*, that aluum follows your verbal commands, including somewhat nuanced orders like "subdue this target" or "strike anyone wearing a blue robe."

The charm grants you control over an aluum you can see within 60 feet, with a level equal to or lower than the charm. This has the effect of [dominate](compendium/spells/dominate.md) and allows a DC 28 Will save. If the aluum is currently under the control of someone wearing its linked charm, it gets a result on its saving throw one degree higher than what it rolled. You can control only one aluum at a time using this activation, and controlling a new aluum ends the effect for one you had previously affected.
