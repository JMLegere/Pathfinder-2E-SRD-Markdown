A standard deck of cards consists of 54 cards made from thick paper contained within a paper sleeve. The most common deck used for games and gambling is known as the Old Mage deck and features four suits themed with the four essences of magic, each with 13 cards, as well as two wildcards. The name and appearance of the deck varies from region to region, such as the Magician's Deck in Taldor or the Deck of Masks in the Shackles.
