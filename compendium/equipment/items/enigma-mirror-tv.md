Mist fills the glass of this small circular hand mirror, creating strange patterns in the shifting gray wisps. The back of the mirror bears a flowing script engraving in an unknown language.

The spell DC of any spell cast by activating this item is 23.

- Armor After you cast an illusion spell by activating the mirror, choose one ally within 30 feet. That ally gains a single illusory image, per mirror image. The image lasts until the end of your next turn if not destroyed before then.
- Weapon After you cast an illusion spell by activating the mirror, illusory copies of the weapon swirl in the air around it. You're affected by the [thicket of knives](compendium/spells/thicket-of-knives-som.md) spell until the end of your next turn. The spell ends if you stop wielding the affixed weapon.
