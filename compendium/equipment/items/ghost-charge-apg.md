These spring-loaded metal canisters contain a mixture of chemicals and salts that drain and disintegrate nearby undead creatures. A ghost charge deals the listed positive damage and splash damage, though as usual for positive damage, this damage harms only undead and creatures with negative healing. Ghost charges are designed to explode even on contact with a spiritual substance, making them ideal for damaging incorporeal undead. A primary target that takes damage from a ghost charge becomes [enfeebled](rules/conditions.md#Enfeebled) until the start of your next turn. Many types grant an item bonus to attack rolls.
