The ghast stiletto afflicts the next living target struck by the dagger with a terrible wound that emits the foul stench of the grave. For the next minute, the target creature, as well as any creatures within a 10-foot emanation, must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or become [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) (plus [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) as long as it's [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) on a critical failure). While within the emanation, the creature takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) condition.

A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.
