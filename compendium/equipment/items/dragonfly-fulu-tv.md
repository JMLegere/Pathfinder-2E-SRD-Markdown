Tradition says the dragonfly fulu should be affixed to the upper back, like the wings of an insect. When you Activate this fulu, you gain a +2 status bonus to [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) checks to [High Jump](rules/actions/high-jump.md) or [Long Jump](rules/actions/long-jump.md) for 1 minute. During this time, you can attempt an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [High Jump](rules/actions/high-jump.md) or [Long Jump](rules/actions/long-jump.md) as a single action without the [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) requirement. You can also [High Jump](rules/actions/high-jump.md) or [Long Jump](rules/actions/long-jump.md) from a nonsolid substance, such as air or water, but if you use this power of the fulu, its effects ends after you jump.
