You cast [pet cache](compendium/spells/pet-cache-apg.md) (Advanced Player's Guide 222) but the accommodations inside the extradimensional space are luxurious and spacious. The food is delicious gourmet cuisine tailored to the pet's palate, the habitat is the perfect temperature and environment for the pet, complete with comfortable bed or lounging area. A pair of phantom hands pamper the pet, patting, grooming, or playing with it at the creature's whim.
