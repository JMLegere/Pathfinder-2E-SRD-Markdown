This fairly simple ring has no gemstone inlaid, but the band is cast to resembled a fanged wolf's head. Once per day, during your daily preparations, you can meditate on this ring to grant yourself 5 temporary Hit Points.

These last until your next daily preparation, as long as you are wearing the ring.
