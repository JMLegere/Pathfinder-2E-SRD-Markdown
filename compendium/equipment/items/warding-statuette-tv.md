This small figurine is carved from soapstone in the shape of a deity or guardian, facing both front and back to indicate unflagging vigilance. The spell attack roll of any spell cast by activating this item is +13.

- Armor You gain resistance 1 against ranged weapon attacks.
- Weapon When you hit with a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) using the affixed weapon, or when a spell effect you created by activating the statuette hits with a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), you can choose a creature adjacent to the creature that was hit. That creature gains a +1 status bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. No more than one creature can benefit from this each turn.
