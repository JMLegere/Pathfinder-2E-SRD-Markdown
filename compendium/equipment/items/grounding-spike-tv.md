Metal caps the bottom of this +1 striking thundering dancer's spear (page 25) and its point gives off the faint smell of ozone. If you hit a target that has been struck by a polarizing mace within the last round, you deal additional electricity damage to the target equal to the number of grounding spike's damage dice. If you critically hit such a target, the creature is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the start of your next turn.

Special The grounding spike pairs with the polarizing mace.
