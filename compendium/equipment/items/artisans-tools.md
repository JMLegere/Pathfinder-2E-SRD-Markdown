# Artisan's Tools *Item 0*

- **Price** 4 gp
- **Bulk** 2
- **Hands** 1 or 2*
- **Category** Adventuring Gear

You need these tools to create items from raw materials with the [Craft](rules/actions/craft.md) skill. Different sets are needed for different work, as determined by the GM; for example, blacksmith's tools differ from woodworker's tools. If you wear your artisan's tools, you can draw and replace them as part of the action that uses them.

> [!pf2-note]  
> You can use the set of tools with one hand if you are wearing it.
