# Frost *Item 8+*

[cold](rules/traits/cold.md) [conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Usage** etched onto a weapon
- **Category** Rune

This weapon is empowered with freezing ice. It deals an additional `1d6` cold damage on a successful [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). On a critical hit, the target is also [slowed](rules/conditions.md#Slowed) until the end of your next turn unless it succeeds at a DC 24 Fortitude save.
