# Bloodbane *Item 8*

[dwarf](rules/traits/dwarf.md) [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Usage** etched onto a clan dagger
- **Category** Rune

A *bloodbane* clan dagger is especially vicious against the ancestral enemies of the clan. When you damage an appropriate type of creature with the weapon, that creature takes 1 [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). The type of creature depends on the clan that made the dagger, but is typically drow, duergar, giant, or orc.

In addition, whenever you inflict [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) with a *bloodbane* weapon (whether from its innate ability or in some other way), the weapon leaves ragged wounds. The bleeding creature must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or become [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened). The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.
