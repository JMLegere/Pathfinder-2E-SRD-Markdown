# Marbles *Item 0*

- **Price** 2 sp
- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Held

These tiny round balls are made of polished stone and colorful glass, and come in a bag of 200. You can pour marbles in an empty square adjacent to you with an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action. The first creature that moves into that square must succeed at a DC 13 [Acrobatics](compendium/skills.md#Acrobatics) check or Reflex save (its choice) or fall [prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone). Once a creature enters a space with marbles, enough marbles are scattered that other creatures moving into that space don't need to attempt a roll to avoid falling.

Merrygleam Toys.
