# Ravenous *Item 1*

[cursed](rules/traits/cursed-gmg.md) [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Usage** curses a ring, staff, or wand
- **Category** Curse

A *ravenous* curse draws power from the wielder's body. Whenever you [activate](rules/actions/activate-an-item.md) the item, you become incredibly hungry and immediately begin to starve ("*Core Rulebook" 500|CRB|10|Starvation and Thirst*). You require 10 times as much food as normal for the next day.
