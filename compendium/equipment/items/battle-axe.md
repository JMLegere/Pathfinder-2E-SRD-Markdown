# Battle Axe *Item 0*

[sweep](rules/traits/sweep.md)  

- **Price** 1 gp
- **Bulk** 1
- **Damage** `1d8` S
- **Hands** 1
- **Category** Martial; **Group** Axe

These axes are designed explicitly as weapons, rather than tools. They typically weigh less, with a shaft reinforced with metal bands or bolts, and have a sharper blade, making them ideal for chopping limbs rather than wood.
