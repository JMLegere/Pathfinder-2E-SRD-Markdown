```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

Your armor anchors you in place, even defying gravity, rendering you [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) until you [Dismiss](rules/actions/dismiss.md) the Activation. While you're [immobilized](rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) in this way, you can be moved only if a creature succeeds at a DC 40 [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check to [Force Open](rules/actions/force-open.md) your armor. You can also be moved if 8,000 pounds of pressure are placed upon you, though this is likely fatal.
