# Rhinoceros Mask *Item 4+*

[invested](rules/traits/invested.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md) [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Usage** worn mask; **Bulk**â€”
- **Category** Worn

Covered with thick armor and bearing a thicker horn, a rhinoceros mask grants you increased momentum. If you [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md) at least 10 feet, your next melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) before the end of your turn ignores the Hardness of objects with a Hardness of 5 or less. If the object has more than Hardness 5, the mask grants no benefit.
