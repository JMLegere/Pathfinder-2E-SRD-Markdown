This 3-foot length of chain is made of a mystical blue-white steel. You can wrap the chain around an item or creature; if a ghost of 9th level or lower is bound to the item or creature via its rejuvenation ability, it cannot rejuvenate if it is destroyed. This chain can't impede a ghost's rejuvenation that is tied to an area, only to an item or creature. At the GM's discretion, the chain of the stilled spirit might work on abilities similar to Rejuvenation that prevent a spirit from going being fully destroyed.
