# Disguise Kit *Item 0*

- **Price** 2 gp
- **Bulk** L
- **Hands** 2
- **Category** Adventuring Gear

This small wooden box contains cosmetics, false facial hair, spirit gum, and a few simple wigs. You usually need a disguise kit to set up a disguise in order to [Impersonate](rules/actions/impersonate.md) someone using the [Deception](compendium/skills.md#Deception) skill. If you've crafted a large number of disguises, you can replenish your cosmetics supply with [replacement cosmetics](compendium/equipment/items/replacement-cosmetics.md) suitable for the type of your disguise kit. You can draw and replace a worn disguise kit as part of the action that uses it.
