# Apparition Gloves *Item 2*

[illusion](rules/traits/illusion.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Price** 25 gp
- **Usage** worn gloves; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Worn

This set of gloves translates whatever the wearer says into the signed version of that language by projecting a ghostly, translucent version of the wearer's hands in front of them. The apparition is a purely visual illusion used for communication, so it can't move on its own, nor can it hold or manipulate objects, or attack.
