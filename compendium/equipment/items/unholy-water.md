An evil deity's malice lies within this vial of water. You activate a vial of unholy water by throwing it as a [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). It's a simple thrown weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn't add the [manipulate](rules/traits/manipulate.md) trait to the attack made with it.

Unholy water deals `1d6` evil damage and 1 evil splash damage.

It damages only celestials and creatures that have a weakness to evil damage.
