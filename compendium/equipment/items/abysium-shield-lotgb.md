# Abysium Shield *Item 8+*

[rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Usage** varies by shield
- **Category** Material

These glowing shields are crafted to ensure that the abysium used is safely contained within a durable outer shell. If the shield breaks, however, the toxic metal becomes exposed. When you use the [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md) reaction against an adjacent creature's melee [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), if the shield breaks, the creature is exposed to the abysium and is [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) for a standard-grade shield or [sickened](rules/conditions.md#Sickened) for a high-grade shield.
