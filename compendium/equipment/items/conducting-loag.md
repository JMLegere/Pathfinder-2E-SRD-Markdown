# Conducting *Item 7*

[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Price** 300 gp
- **Usage** etched onto a weapon
- **Category** Rune

A conducting weapon can channel energy through it. The weapon gains the resonant weapon trait, except that when you [Conduct Energy](rules/actions/conduct-energy-loag.md), the weapon deals an additional `1d8` damage of the selected type instead of 1 additional damage per die; if the weapon already had the resonant weapon trait, it deals `1d8` damage plus 1 damage per die instead. On a critical hit, the weapon deals `1d8` [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) of the same type.
