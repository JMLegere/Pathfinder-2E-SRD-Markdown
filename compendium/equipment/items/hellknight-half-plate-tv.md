Hellknights wear a variety of armors decorated with designs specific to the order. [Hellknight half plate](compendium/equipment/items/hellknight-half-plate-tv.md) is the armor of choice for Hellknight signifiers, and [Hellknight breastplate](compendium/equipment/items/hellknight-breastplate-tv.md) serves those in the order who lack the training to wear heavy armor.

A character who is a member of the Hellknights has access to these uncommon armors.
