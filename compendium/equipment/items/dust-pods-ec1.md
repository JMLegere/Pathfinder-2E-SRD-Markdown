# Dust Pods *Item 1*

[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md) [mechanical](rules/traits/mechanical.md) [snare](rules/traits/snare.md) [trap](rules/traits/trap.md) [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 3 gp
- **Category** Snare

You hide fragile pods of pollen or other clinging powder that get in the eyes of the first creature that enters the snare's square. The creature must attempt a DC 17 Reflex saving throw. A creature [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) by the pollen can use an [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action to attempt a DC 5 flat check to remove the condition.

> [!success-degree]
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature is [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round.
> - **Failure** The creature is [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 10 minutes.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is [blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round and [dazzled](rules/conditions.md#Dazzled) for 10 minutes after.
