# Noqual Armor *Item 12+*

[rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** varies by armor
- **Category** Material

The mere sight of a suit of noqual armor is enough to make some opposing spellcasters withdraw from the battlefield.

While wearing noqual armor, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against spell attack rolls. If you [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) while wearing noqual armor, you must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the spell fails.
