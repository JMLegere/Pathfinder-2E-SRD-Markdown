# Enfilading Arrow *Item 9*

[conjuration](rules/traits/conjuration.md) [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 125 gp
- **Ammunition** [Arrow](compendium/equipment/items/arrow.md)
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)
- **Category** Consumable

This arrow splits at the far end of the shaft into five branching arrowheads, making it impractical for single targets but deadly in combat.

When you fire an activated enfilading arrow, it sails upward and shatters into countless copies. The arrows then rain Bellwether Lodge Wares.
