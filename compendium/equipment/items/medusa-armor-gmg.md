# Medusa Armor *Item 14*

[cursed](rules/traits/cursed-gmg.md) [invested](rules/traits/invested.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [rare](rules/traits/rare.md) [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md)  

- **Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** 3
- **Category** Armor

This +2 adamantine scale mail appears to have a fortification rune but grants none of its effects. Whenever you are critically hit, after taking damage, you become [petrified](rules/conditions.md#Petrified) for 1 round.

Once the curse has activated for the first time, the armor fuses to you.
