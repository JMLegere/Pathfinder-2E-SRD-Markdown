This very small shield is a favorite of duelists and quick, lightly armored warriors. It's typically made of steel and strapped to your forearm. You can [Raise a Shield](rules/actions/raise-a-shield.md) with your buckler as long as you have that hand free or are holding a light object that's not a weapon in that hand.
