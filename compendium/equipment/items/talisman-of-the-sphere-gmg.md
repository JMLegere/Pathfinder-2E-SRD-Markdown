# Talisman Of The Sphere *Item 20*

[artifact](rules/traits/artifact-gmg.md) [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [rare](rules/traits/rare.md)  

- **Usage** held in 1 hand
- **Category** Artifact

This loop of adamantine can be slung on a chain to be worn as a necklace, but must be held to convey its benefits. A creature that can't cast either arcane or occult spells takes `8d6` mental damage just from picking up the item, and they take that damage again at the start of each of their turns if they continue to hold it.

If the wielder can cast arcane or occult spells, they can use the talisman of the sphere to more easily control a sphere of annihilation. This reduces the DC of the check to control the sphere or Sustain the Activation by 10.
