# Toy Carriage *Item 0+*

- **Category** Adventuring Gear

A miniature toy carriage is carved from wood and has fully functioning wheels. It can vary in size from 2 to 8 inches long, too small for even Tiny creatures to ride. If pushed or propelled, obstacles and terrain might slow, stop, tip, or divert the carriage's course.
