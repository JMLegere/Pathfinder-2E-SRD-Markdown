# Gliding *Item 8*

[magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [transmutation](rules/traits/transmutation.md)

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You glide slowly toward the ground, 5 feet down and up to 25 feet forward through the air. Provided you spend at least 1 action gliding on your turn and haven't yet reached the ground, you remain in the air at the end of your turn. Otherwise, you fall.
