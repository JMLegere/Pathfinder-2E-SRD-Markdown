You rig a snare to disorient a creature with a quick bash, leaving it with little ability to defend itself. The trap deals `6d6` bludgeoning damage to the first creature to enter its square; that creature must attempt a DC 31 Reflex save.

> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) for 1 round and [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) for 1 minute and [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned).
