# Bastion of the Inheritor *Item 12*

[enchantment](rules/traits/enchantment.md) [invested](rules/traits/invested.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 1750 gp
- **Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** 5
- **Category** Armor

Worn by [Iomedae](compendium/setting/deities/iomedae.md)'s prestigious knights, this +2 resilient bastion plate is emblazoned with the Inheritor's religious symbol and sports a white cloak. While the cloak is white, this armor grants you a +2 item bonus to [Diplomacy](compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy) checks to [Make an Impression](rules/actions/make-an-impression.md), provided your target has no enmity toward [Iomedae](compendium/setting/deities/iomedae.md).

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

The armor's cloak becomes red for 1 minute. As long as the cloak is red, you gain the benefits of the armor's deflect melee trait without needing to spend an additional action to activate it during each turn.
