This long, hollow proboscis is harvested from the notorious bloodseeker beast and drips a trickle of blood. When you activate the beak, you deal an extra `1d4` precision damage on your damage roll. If you deal sneak attack damage to the creature, you also deal `1d4` [persistent bleed damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
