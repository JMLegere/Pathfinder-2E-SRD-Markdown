An alchemical substance applied to one end of this tiny wooden stick ignites when struck against a rough surface. Creating a flame with a tindertwig is much faster than creating a flame with flint and steel. You can ignite the tindertwig and touch it to a flammable object as part of the same [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md) action.
