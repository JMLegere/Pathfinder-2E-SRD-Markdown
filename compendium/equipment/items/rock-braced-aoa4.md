*Rock-braced* armor makes you as hard to move as a boulder. Whenever another creature attempts to forcibly move you from your space, you gain a +4 item bonus to your Fortitude DC against the check to move you. If the creature would not normally need to attempt a check to move you, then the creature must succeed at an [Athletics](compendium/skills.md#Athletics) check against your Fortitude DC (including the +4 item bonus) or you are unmoved.
