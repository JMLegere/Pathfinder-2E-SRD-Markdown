# Returning *Item 3*

[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Price** 55 gp
- **Usage** etched onto a thrown weapon
- **Category** Rune

When you make a thrown [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) with this weapon, it flies back to your hand after the [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md) is complete. If your hands are full when the weapon returns, it falls to the ground in your space.
