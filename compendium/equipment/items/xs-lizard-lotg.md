# X's Lizard *Item 0*

- **Price** 1 gp
- **Category** Pet

Named after the druid that popularized them, these black-and-white lizards have substantial stomachs and a rather slow digestive system. X trained these lizards to keep valuables in their stomachs. They swallow specially treated purses with attached chains that clip to a collar, which can hold objects up to 1 Bulk. The contents of the purse stay safe for one month before slowly dissolving.
