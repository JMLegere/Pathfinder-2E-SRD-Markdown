# Wand Cane *Item 4*

[magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [wand](rules/traits/wand.md)  

- **Price** 100 gp
- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Wand

Though it appears to be a basic cane, the inner workings of the wand cane are an intricate network of lenses and magical circuits, with a slot at the top to insert a wand. The wand cane then spends 1 minute attuning to the wand, after which the wand can be used through the cane.
