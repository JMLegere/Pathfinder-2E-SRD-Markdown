# Sun Shot *Item 0*

- **Price** 1 sp
- **Bulk** L
- **Category** Ammunition

A sun sling is a small staff with a head of woven netting. The staff is small enough to hold in a single hand, making it useful for hit-and-run tactics, but once loaded with ammunition, it requires two hands to properly swing and fire. Sun slings use small metal bullets covered in sharp spikes known as sun shots.
