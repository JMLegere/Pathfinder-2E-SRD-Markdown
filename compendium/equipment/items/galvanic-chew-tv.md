[electricity](rules/traits/electricity.md)  

- **Trigger**: You're hit by a melee attack or touched by a creature

**Effect** You channel electricity into the triggering creature, which must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or be [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) (or [stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) on a critical failure). The chew becomes inert. You're then temporarily immune to galvanic chews for 24 hours or until the next time you make your daily preparations.
