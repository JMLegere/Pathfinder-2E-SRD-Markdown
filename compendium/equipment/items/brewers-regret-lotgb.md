# Brewer's Regret *Item 9+*

[alchemical](rules/traits/alchemical.md) [consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md) [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L
- **Activate** [Interact](rules/actions/interact.md)
- **Category** Consumable

When a brewer makes a batch of something they'd rather not drink, they often boil it down; add myrrh, mugwort extract, and violet salt; and sell it to chefs looking for cheap sandwich fillings. The thick, salty sourness ruins the taste of most other food, but it also creates a strong desire to live to taste anything else. For 1 hour after consumption, you gain a +2 item bonus to saves against [death](rules/traits/death.md) and [negative](rules/traits/negative.md) effects.

In addition, your [doomed](rules/conditions.md#Doomed) value decreases by 1 (minimum 0)

You can reduce the [doomed](rules/conditions.md#Doomed) condition with brewer's regret only once per day, and after you do, you can't reduce the [doomed](rules/conditions.md#Doomed) condition from the [restoration](compendium/spells/restoration.md) spell that same day (or vice versa).
