# Darkwood Armor *Item 12+*

[uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** varies by armor
- **Category** Material

Darkwood armor is 1 Bulk lighter than normal (or light Bulk if its normal Bulk is 1, with no effect on armor that normally has light Bulk). It's easier to wear than normal wood armor, reducing the Strength score necessary to ignore its check penalty by 2 and reducing its Speed penalty by 5 feet. (There are no types of wood armor in this book.)
