This subtle pattern of complex dots, sunbursts, and lines is difficult to make out, as it's a near match for the wearer's skin tone. Serving as a barrier facing inward, this tattoo prevents ostentatious expressions of spells that are internal to you, making them easier to hide.

If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](rules/actions/cast-a-spell.md) of 2nd level or lower that affects or targets only you, you can hide that you're casting it.

This has the same effect as the Conceal Spell feat (Core Rulebook 210).
