# Poisonous Dagger *Item 5*

[magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [necromancy](rules/traits/necromancy.md) [poison](rules/traits/poison.md)  

- **Price** 150 gp
- **Category** Weapon

This dagger has an image of a snake emblazoned on its blade. When you critically succeed at an attack roll with the dagger, magical fangs emerge and poison the target, dealing `1d4` [persistent poison damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
