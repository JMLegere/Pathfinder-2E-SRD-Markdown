This elegant journal has a detailed social dossier on the owner's acquaintances. When you make your daily preparations, you can inscribe a secret or embarrassing foible about a specific individual that you know to be true or have on good authority.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [F](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action")

If your next action is to cast an enchantment spell on a target about whom you've written an entry in the book, you can state that secret or foible before Casting the Spell to give the target a â€“1 circumstance penalty to their saving throw against the spell.

The inscription then disappears from the grimoire.
