Using a writing set, you can draft correspondence and scribe scrolls. A set includes stationery, including a variety of paper and parchment, as well as ink, a quill or inkpen, sealing wax, and a simple seal. If you've written a large amount, you can refill your kit with [extra ink and paper](compendium/equipment/items/extra-ink-and-paper.md).
