Chronicler wayfinders bear a mystical connection to the Pathfinder Chronicles themselves, granting them the ability to assist in situations where unusual lore is needed by drawing on lore from a particular topic. Each chronicler wayfinder is attuned to a specific [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill, chosen at the time of creation. In addition to the effects of a wayfinder (Core Rulebook 617), a chronicler wayfinder has the following activation.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

You tap into the Pathfinder Chronicles on the chronicler wayfinder's attuned topic, gaining the effects of a [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) action with the chosen [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill. For the [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) check's modifier, use whichever is better of +12 or your own modifier, using your level as your proficiency bonus even if you're untrained in the attuned [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill.
