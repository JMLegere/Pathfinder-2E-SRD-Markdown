This +1 leather lamellar armor incorporates the plates of a rust monster's hide, woven together with the creature's own antennae and sinew into a functional set of armor. While wearing the rusting carapace, you gain a +2 item bonus to your Reflex save to prevent an object you're holding from being affected by rust; this also increases your Reflex DC to avoid being Disarmed by a rust monster's Antenna Disarm ability.

Feathery antennae extend from between the segments of the rusting hide and brush against a nearby metal creature, non-magical metal hazard, or non-magical metal item of up to 1 Bulk, with the effects of rusting grasp. The DC is 24.
