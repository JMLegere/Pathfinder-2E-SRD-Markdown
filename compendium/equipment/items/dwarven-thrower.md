This +2 striking warhammer is inlaid with precious metals and decorated with geometric patterns in a dwarven style. If you're a dwarf, a dwarven thrower functions for you as a +2 greater striking returning warhammer with the thrown <30 feet> trait, and your attacks with the hammer deal `1d8` additional damage against giants.
