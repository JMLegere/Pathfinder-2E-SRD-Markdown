You use the mortar of [hidden](rules/conditions.md#Hidden) meaning to grind tea leaves (or another suitable substance for making a hot beverage). While grinding the tea leaves, which takes no less than 1 minute, you can speak a message into the mortar. After the leaves are steeped in hot water, the first person who drinks from the resulting brew hears the message whispered in their ear.
