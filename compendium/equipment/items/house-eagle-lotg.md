# House Eagle *Item 0*

- **Price** 10 gp
- **Category** Pet

These smaller falcons feature the brown-and-white markings of eagles and are popular among Eagle Knights. They serve both as a symbol of national pride and help keep watch in the field. They can be kept in a home but require a dedicated perch. They're known for pouncing on and tearing up floor rugs.
