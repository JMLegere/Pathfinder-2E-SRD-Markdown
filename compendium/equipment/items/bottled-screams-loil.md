The vengeful wails of a revenant, barely contained in this rattling jar, infuse your magic with all of their spite and malice. If a target fails its saving throw against your seal fate (Advanced Player's Guide 224) spell after you've added this catalyst, it takes `1d6` [persistent damage](rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) of the type chosen for the spell (`2d6` if it critically fails).
