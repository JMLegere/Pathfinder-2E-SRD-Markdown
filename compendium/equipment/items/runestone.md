# Runestone *Item 1*

[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Price** 3 gp
- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Consumable

This flat piece of hard stone is specially prepared for etching a magical fundamental rune or property rune. You can etch only one rune upon a stone. Once the stone is etched, it gains the magic school trait of the rune etched upon it. When a rune is transferred from the runestone to another object, the runestone cracks and is destroyed. The Price listed is for an empty stone; a stone holding a rune adds the Price of the rune.
