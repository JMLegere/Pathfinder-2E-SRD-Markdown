An energizing treat is a treat made from meat or grains. When you feed your animal companion or familiar an energizing treat, it's [quickened](rules/conditions.md#Quickened) for 1 minute. It can use the extra action each round only for [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md), [Stride](rules/actions/stride.md), and Support actions, and it can do so only if it normally has those actions available and you take the proper action to command it.
