# Impactful *Item 10+*

[evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md) [force](rules/traits/force.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md)  

- **Usage** etched onto a weapon
- **Category** Rune

This rune thrums with pure magical energy. Weapons with the rune deal an additional `1d6` force damage on a successful [Strike](rules/actions/strike.md). On a critical hit, you can choose to force the target to succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or be pushed 5 feet away from you.
