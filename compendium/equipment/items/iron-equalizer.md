# Iron Equalizer *Item 12*

[consumable](rules/traits/consumable.md) [evocation](rules/traits/evocation.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [talisman](rules/traits/talisman.md)  

- **Price** 400 gp
- **Usage** affixed to a weapon; **Bulk**â€”
- **Activate** [Certain Strike](compendium/feats/certain-strike.md); **Requirements** You are a master with the affixed weapon.
- **Category** Talisman

This small iron band has a shifting weight that helps equalize the affixed weapon's balance. When you activate it, you use [Certain Strike](compendium/feats/certain-strike.md), as the fighter feat. You must meet the normal requirements, including those of the [press](rules/traits/press.md) trait.

If you have the [Certain Strike](compendium/feats/certain-strike.md) feat, the failure effect increases to deal the weapon's normal damage.
