# Anchoring *Item 10+*

[abjuration](rules/traits/abjuration.md) [magical](rules/traits/magical.md) [uncommon](rules/traits/uncommon.md)  

- **Usage** etched onto a weapon
- **Category** Rune

This rune prevents enemies from escaping your grasp by [fleeing](rules/conditions.md#Fleeing) to other planes. If you critically hit a target with an anchoring weapon, the weapon casts [dimensional anchor](compendium/spells/dimensional-anchor.md) on the target (DC 27, counteract modifier +17).
