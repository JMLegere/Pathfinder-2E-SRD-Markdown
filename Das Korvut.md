# Das Korvut

#npc  

**Das Korvut** is the owner of the [[15 Red Dog Smithy]] in the town of [[Sandpoint]] in [[Varisia]]. He is a bald and strong man who has a great affection for large [red mastiffs](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Dog "Dog") and little patience for his customers and everyone else. The town suffers his foul-mouthed attitude and frequent drunken midnight rants because he is a really good blacksmith
