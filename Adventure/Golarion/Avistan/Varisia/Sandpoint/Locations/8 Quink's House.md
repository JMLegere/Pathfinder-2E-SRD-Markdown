The sole occupant of this location is Brodert Quink, a balding scholar of Varisian history and engineering. Brodert claims to have spent 2 decades of his youth studying with dwarven engineers at Janderhoff and 3 decades as a cataloger at the Founder's Archive in Magnimar, and he's continually baffled and enraged that his learning and obvious intelligence haven't afforded him more prestige. Brodert has been studying ancient Thassilonian ruins for the past several years and has recently become obsessed with the Old Light. No one believes his theories that the tower was once a war machine capable of spewing fire to a range of more than a mileâ€”but now that the truth about Thassilon and its runelords is finally coming out, people have begun to wonder if old Quink wasn't onto something all along.
