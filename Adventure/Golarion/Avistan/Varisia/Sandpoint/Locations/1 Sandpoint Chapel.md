**Rumor**

> *"Everyone's still shocked that Nualia was the one behind the goblin raids a few years back. I know those adventurers say she fell in combat, but now and then you hear folks claiming to have spotted her. She grew up at the Cathedral. If she's anywhere in town, I bet she's hiding out in there, or maybe in some sort of hidden complex underground!" (**False**, unless Nualia happened to survive the events of Rise of the Runelords for your group, in which case the rumor could be true, at your discretion!)"*

Easily the largest building in [[Sandpoint]], this impressive cathedral is also the town's newest structure. Built over the foundations of the previous chapel, the Sandpoint Cathedral is not dedicated to the worship of a single deity. Rather, it gathers under its eaves the six most commonly worshiped deities in the region: [[Abadar]], [[Desna]], [[Erastil]], [[Gozreh]], [[Sarenrae]], and [[Shelyn]]. The building provides chapels for all of these deities in a communal forum—in a way, Sandpoint Cathedral is six different churches under one impressive roof.

Yet even the previous chapel wasn't the first holy site in this location. The core of both the original chapel and the new cathedral is an open-air courtyard surrounding a set of seven standing stones, which themselves surround a circular stone altar. These stones served the Varisians for centuries as a place of worship; although the Varisians generally venerated Desna and various Empyreal Lords at these stones, the stones themselves have a much older tradition. Unknown to anyone alive today, the seven standing stones once represented the seven Thassilonian schools of magic and served as a focus for wizards who wished to direct the destructive power of the nearby Hellstorm Flume. No one in Sandpoint suspects the standing stones are anything more than an ancient site of worship. Varisian oral tradition maintains that the seven stones represent the seven towers of Desna's palace, but this is merely a story perpetuated by early Varisian seers, who were eager to hide yet another scrap of their homeland's destructive history.

The original chapel hosted a collection of six different shrines, each housed in its own building and connected to the others by open-air walkways. Desna's worship was incorporated into these shrines as part of the peace accord with the local Varisians, but the original builders included five other deities as well. Four of these (Abadar, Gozreh, Sarenrae, and Shelyn) were patrons of the original founders of the Sandpoint Mercantile League, while the fifth, Erastil, was the most popular among the initial settlers. The previous chapel hosted not quite a dozen acolytes led by a cleric named Ezakien Tobyn and his adopted daughter Nualia. While Father Tobyn was well loved by the townsfolk, in private life he was an oppressive and overprotective father who failed to see that Nualia was stifling under his patriarchal rule. When she rebelled against his control and fell in with a cad named Delek only to become pregnant, Ezakien overreacted and forbade her from leaving the church so that he could watch over her and lecture her on the virtues she should follow. In so doing, he not only fell from Desna's grace but also nurtured Nualia's growing hatred, which became magnified when one of Alaznist's minor runewells of wrath flared to life below town. Nualia miscarried her child and fell into a coma, only to waken some time later as a pawn of Lamashtu. She jammed her father's door as he slept, lit the church on fire, and fled Sandpoint to later lead the goblin raids on the town. The fire spread quickly. As the town rallied to save the church, the inferno expanded, consuming the North Coast Stables, the White Deer Inn, and three homes. In the end, the church burned to the ground, leaving the town's beloved priest Ezakien Tobyn, all of his acolytes, and (so the town believed at the time) Nualia dead. It would be years before Sandpoint recovered  
from the tragedy. When the chapel burned to the ground, Mayor Kendra Deverin set into motion a bold initiative. Not only would the chapel be rebuilt, but it would be rebuilt on a grand scale. A cathedral would be constructed in place of the chapel, and it would be made of stone and glass. Funding for this project came partially from the founding families, partially from Sandpoint businesses eager to earn favor in the eyes of the gods, and partially from the respective churches. It took years to finish the cathedral, but the end result is truly impressive. To the south, facing Sandpoint's heart, are the shrines of civilization: Erastil and Abadar. To the west, offering a view of the Old Light and the sea beyond, are the shrines of Shelyn and Gozreh. And to the east, offering a view of the Sandpoint Boneyard and the rising sun, are the shrines of Sarenrae and Desna. Today, the town's high priest is a pleasant man named Abstalar Zantus. As with Father Tobyn before him, Father Zantus is a worshiper of Desna, but one more even-minded than his predecessor and more welcoming in his personality. Abstalar is very open about matters of faith and has slipped with ease into the role of advisor for worshipers of other gods of Sandpoint. Underneath the cathedral are two separate entrances to an old set of smugglers' tunnels. The first was located behind a secret door in the basement in the western wing—it was this entrance that Nualia discovered and  
used in order to come and go without her father's notice. When Ezakien discovered the door and confined his daughter to her quarters, he bricked this entrance up. Father Zantus knows about the entrance and suspects that he'll need to break it down soon to investigate  
strange noises (see Area 2), but at least for now he has left this entrance sealed. The second entrance has so far gone unnoticed by everyone in modern Sandpoint; it consists of a chamber that hasn't been used for its proper purpose in ages. Directly under the central ring of stones that once served as a focus for the Hellstorm Flume lies a small set of rooms. The method to cause the central stone above to rise and sink into the ground still functions but hasn't been activated in thousands of years. See Smugglers' Tunnels on page 68 for more information.
