# Hag's Plummet

#location  

**Hag's Plummet** is a cliff southwest of [[Sandpoint]] that is popular as both a lover's getaway and suicide jump. It's name comes from a [[Varisia|Varisian]] legend. [[Yenneke Avertin]] was dismayed at being less beautiful than her sisters. A witch gave her a [[potion|Potion]] to keep her young and beautiful with the caveat that it would only last until she fell in love. Years later, the lonely [[Yenneke Avertin|Yenneke]] fell in love, aged immediately, and was rejected by her love. She cast herself off this cliff in her sorrow.
