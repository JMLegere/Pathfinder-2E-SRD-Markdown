# Sandpoint Smuggler's Tunnels

Although many of the complexes under Sandpoint (the Underflume below the Old Light, the Catacombs of Wrath and its temple of Lamashtu under the western area of Uptown, the Shrine of Pazuzu under Chopper's Isle, and the old catacombs below the Cathedral) existed long before the town was founded, several other areas below Sandpoint are of much more recent construction. These areas were originally built in the first decade of the town's youth by a well-connected and productive group of smugglers called the [[Kaspakar Veil]] (or simply the "Veil"). Using their skills at engineering and supported by a few earth elementalist wizards, the Veil managed to excavate a fair number of tunnels below Sandpoint. They had secret alliances with the Kaijitsus, the Scarnettis, and the Valdemars, all three of whom thought they were the only family in town to have hidden associations with the Veil. At one point, they accidentally broke into the Catacombs of Wrath, but after a frightening encounter with the quasit who ruled that dungeon, the smugglers instead bricked the tunnel over and left the catacombs alone.

The Veil had agents in [[Riddleport]] and [[Magnimar]] as well and had plans to take over [[Sandpoint]] from within and use the town as their own secret base of operations—and they may have succeeded in their shadowy plan, had their leader not crossed a man named Iremiel, then high-priest of the temple of Calistria in Magnimar.

[[Iremriel]] discovered the Veil's presence in Sandpoint accidentally, during a visit with his secret lover, [[Vernah]]. She complained to Iremiel of an obnoxious man's constant and unwelcome attempts to at first woo her and, after she spurned him, to buy her shop out from under her. When Iremiel investigated, he learned the man was an agent of the Veil, and that the smugglers' base of operations was located directly under Vernah's shop. Worse, he discovered the Veil would stop at nothing to gain control of the shop, as they wanted to take over ownership of all the buildings above their base of operations so as to have multiple hidden entrances and exits from their hideout. Since Vernah had stymied their attempts at seduction and monetary temptation, the Veil was planning on having Vernah meet with an unfortunate accident very soon.

Iremiel started a one-man campaign against the [[Kaspakar Veil|Veil]]. Initially, his focus was on making the cost of doing business in town too much for the Veil to remain, but he underestimated their tenacity and stubbornness. When things escalated, Iremiel was forced to slaughter the Veil agents in Sandpoint, doing so under the cover of darkness during a particularly stormy night. This grisly ordeal culminated at a hidden shrine of Norgorber that the Veil had built under central Sandpoint, and it nearly cost Iremiel his life.

Vernah didn't question where Iremiel received his wounds when the elf appeared at her stoop, near death and exhausted. She took him in and kept him from succumbing to his wounds in those last few hours before dawn, when Iremiel recovered his healing capacity and was able to heal himself. Their daughter was conceived soon after, and as it became apparent that Vernah was pregnant, Iremiel finally told her the whole truth. She asked him to retire and come be a family, and he agreed. Iremiel spent the next nine months arranging for a replacement at the temple in Magnimar while secretly repurposing the old shrine to Norgorber once used by the Veil into a shrine of Calistria.

His daughter, Rynshinn, was born a few days before he made his official public "retirement" from the church. Leaving the Magnimarian church in the capable hands of another elf, a woman named Ayamyra, Iremiel moved in with Vernah a few days after their daughter was born.

Unfortunately for Iremiel, his official retirement from the church was his death sentence, for the sinister sponsor of the Kaspakar Veil had been watching and waiting. This was the Forever Man—guild master of Magnimar's thieves and a very vengeful man. By waiting for Iremiel's association with the church to publicly end before making his move, the Forever Man cunningly avoided escalating the cycle of vengeance even further. He assassinated Iremiel a week after he moved to Sandpoint, killing him in his own shrine to Calistria and leaving the body there, hidden away behind secret doors for years to come. Vernah never found out what happened to Iremiel, but she never gave up hope that he still lived (see Vernah's Fine Clothing on page 38 for details on Vernah, and Shroud's Shrine on page 74 for more on Iremiel's legacy).

For several years thereafter, the smugglers' tunnels lay quiet and forgotten, but when Jubrayl Vhiski gathered a group of like-minded Sczarni thugs together and founded the Bunyip Club, the tunnels began to see use  
once again. At the opposite end of town from where the Bunyip Club were busy reclaiming the tunnels, a band of ghouls burrowed into the tunnels after expanding their warren below the Sandpoint Boneyard, inadvertently connecting the smugglers' tunnels to the Hellstorm catacombs below the church. The tunnels also served Thistletop's goblins as a hidden route into town during the events following the Swallowtail raid.

Today, the smugglers' tunnels feature a number of diverse and dangerous places for adventurers to explore. Recently, a group of goblins seeking a safe place to live have moved into a small, mostly forgotten hideout in the tunnels, and the shrine of Calistria—as well as Iremiel's body—has been discovered by a woman who needed  
a new focus in life. The Catacombs of Wrath remain mostly empty after heroes cleared them (and the temple of Lamashtu below—see Rise of the Runelords for maps of these areas) out a few years back, but five other areas of note are detailed briefly below.

Several secret doors exist in the tunnels; all require a successful **DC 20 Perception** check to discover.
