- **Notes**

The sign in front of this shop depicts a wide-eyed goblin reading an upside-down book nearly as tall as him. Inside, this bookshop is a testament to one man's
obsession with the printed word. [[Chask Haladan]] has maintained his love affair with books for nearly 70 years and shows no sign of giving it up anytime soon. His store is surprisingly well stocked, and while almost all of his wares are far too pricey for any of the locals to shop here with any frequency, a nest egg gathered in his adventurous youth combined with a frugal lifestyle makes the success of his business secondary to his own satisfaction. Several locals, including [[Brodert Quink]] (area 8), [[Jabyl Sorn]] (area 19), and [[Ilsoari Gandethus]] (area 27), can often be found here, either chatting with Chask or sitting in one of several large chairs, nose
deep in a book. Chask has recently come to believe that he's got rats— big ones—infesting the crawl space below his store, but he's never seen one, just periodically hears them scrambling. He doesn't realize that what he's hearing are goblins getting a bit too loud in the tunnels below his shop (see Smugglers' Tunnels on page 68 for more details).
