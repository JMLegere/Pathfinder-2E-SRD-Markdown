# 2 Sandpoint Boneyard

#location

> Set in the shadow of the Sandpoint Cathedral and accessible via a gate to the north or from several doors leading into the main cathedral, this expansive cemetery overlooks the Turandarok River. Stone vaults owned by affluent families stand near the cemetery's edges or at its center, while dozens of humble plots, each marked with a simple gravestone, sit amid trees and shrubberies. The boneyard is well maintained by [[Naffer Vosk]], a smuggler [[Father Tobyn]] took pity on after [[Naffer Vosk|Naffer]]'s ship wrecked just north of town a decade ago. Naffer has found redemption in Sarenrae, and is one of the town's most devout citizens. Despite a twisted spine that has given him an awkward lurching gait ever since he could walk, Naffer works to keep the Sandpoint Boneyard meticulously clean, and rings the church bells every day at dawn, noon, and dusk.

**TOWN CEMETERY**  

**Location** No address; located east of Sandpoint Cathedral  

**Notable NPCs**  
[[Naffer Vosk]], gravedigger (NG male human rogue 1/cleric  
of Sarenrae 2)  

**Rumor** "Now and then you hear about someone hearing  
strange sounds in the boneyard—scratching noises, almost  
like someone got buried alive and was trying to claw their  
way out of the coffin. Me? I think it's just people either  
getting too drunk or looking to spook us just for fun."  
(True; the sounds are real but not that common—people  
are catching the faint sounds of ghouls stealthily crawling  
around in the warrens below the ground.)
