The **Order of the Nail** is an order of [[rules/traits/hellknight-locg|Hellknight]]s based in [[Citadel Vraid]] near [[Korvosa]]. It concerns itself with quelling "savage" practices and bringing their idea of civilization to the inhabitants of the wild frontier.

## Philosophy

To certain dogmatic, rigid-minded individuals, civilization seems under siege. Beyond the bulwarks of cities and national borders lies an endless expanse of wilderness populated by those who, all too often, shun the rules of settled, [[lawful|Lawful]] societies and follow their own callings. To the Order of the Nail, these beings enviously prey upon the children of the law, seeking to draw civilization into a regressive mire. The Order of the Nail stands staunchly against what it views as barbarity.

## History

One of the original seven orders of [[rules/traits/hellknight-locg|Hellknight]]s founded in [4638 AR](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/4638_AR "4638 AR"), the Order of the Nail was coaxed to relocate to [[Varisia]] in [4682 AR](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/4682_AR "4682 AR")[3](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Order_of_the_Nail#cite_note-PF145-76-3) by [[Korvosa]]'s Queen [[Domina Arabasti]]. Although the belief of the Queen was that her invitation and generosity would make the Hellknights indebted to the crown, this was not the case, and the government has since held a decades-old grudge against the Order. The Hellknights instead pursue their own agenda and follow their own ideals of law and justice. Even so, they have aided the city on several occasions (after being well-compensated) and their subjugation of the surrounding wilds have been of assistance to the Korvosan crown. Feared and misunderstood by both the populace and the city guard, the Hellknights are sometimes referred to as "Domina's Devils".

## Magnimar

Impressed by their efficiency and devotion to law, the [[Justice Court]] of [[Magnimar]] invited a detachment of Order of the Nail Hellknights to their city. The commanders in [[Citadel Vraid]] eagerly took them up on the offer to bring their brand of order to a place notorious for its lack of strong laws. The unit is garrisoned in the [[Bastion of the Nail]] in the [[Naos District]] under the command of Paralictor [[Darean Halst]]. Even though their numbers are few, they are fiendishly devoted to their charge. The Hellknights often take protection contracts more dangerous than any other mercenary company would dare.[6](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Order_of_the_Nail#cite_note-6)[7](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Order_of_the_Nail#cite_note-7) When not working on a particular contract, the members of this unit patrol the city looking for trouble, especially in the distant [Ordellia district](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Ordellia "Ordellia"), where even the town guard does not often venture. Amongst the Magnimarians, the Order of the Nail Hellknights are colloquially known as **The Nine of [[Magnimar]]**.
